## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

-For testing I used Storybook and Jest.

### What I learned

I learned that most weather APIS want money for more than the most basic service. lol.

### Useful resources

- [Weather API](https://weatherstack.com/) - It's a nice API and they have really good docs.
- [Location API](https://positionstack.com) - It's an API from the same company as above.
